[[overview]]
== Summary and Assumptions

[[overview-http-verbs]]
== HTTP verbs

This sample implementation adheres to following HTTP/REST conventions while using HTTP verbs.

|===

| `POST`
| Used to create a new resource

| `PUT`
| Used to update an existing resource.
|===


[[overview-http-status]]
== HTTP Status Codes

This sample Framework Contract API adheres to the following HTTP status codes for expressing its results .

|===
| Status code | Usage

| `200 OK`
| The request completed successfully

| `201 Created`
| A new resource has been created successfully. The resource's URI is available from the response's
`Location` header

| `422 Unprocessable Entity`
| The 422 (Unprocessable Entity) status code means the server understands the content type of the request entity
(hence a 415(Unsupported Media Type) status code is inappropriate), and the syntax of the request entity is correct
(thus a 400 (Bad Request) status code is inappropriate) but was unable to process the contained instructions.

| `400 Bad Request`
| The request was malformed. The response body will include an error providing further information

| `404 Not Found`
| The requested resource does not exist
